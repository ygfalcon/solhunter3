# Usage

## Autopilot
Automatically selects the only keypair and active configuration, then launches all services and the trading loop. It ensures the
`solhunter-wallet` CLI is installed and will provision a default keypair automatically, falling back to a non-interactive quick
setup if necessary:

```bash
python scripts/start_all.py autopilot
```
Use the `--testnet` flag to submit orders to a testnet DEX endpoint, `--dry-run` to skip order submission entirely, `--offline` to avoid network requests and use a static token list, or `--token-list <file>` to load token addresses from a file. Use `--strategy-rotation-interval N` with one or more `--weight-config` files to automatically test and switch weight presets every `N` iterations.

## Investor Demo

Run a small rolling backtest and generate lightweight reports:

```bash
python demo.py --reports reports
```

This writes `summary.json`, `trade_history.csv` and `highlights.json` to the
specified reports directory and prints brief snippets to the console.

Enable a lightweight reinforcement‑learning stub:

```bash
python demo.py --rl-demo --reports reports
```

Run a canned learning loop that rotates strategy weights:

```bash
python demo.py --learn --reports reports
```

Exercise the full system with heavier dependencies:

```bash
python demo.py --full-system --reports reports
```

All modes emit the same report files along with console summaries.

### Paper Trading

Mirror the investor demo while optionally fetching live price data:

```bash
python paper.py --reports reports --url https://example.com/prices.json
```

Omit ``--url`` or pass ``--preset`` to use one of the bundled datasets.

## MEV Bundles

When `use_mev_bundles` is enabled (the default), swaps are submitted
through the [Jito block-engine](https://jito.network/). On first launch
the toolkit checks for `JITO_AUTH`; if it is missing, a new token is
requested from Jito's authentication service using your wallet keypair
and saved to `.env`. The same credentials can also be used to subscribe
to Jito's searcher websocket for real‑time pending transactions. To use
a custom token instead, set `JITO_AUTH` in the environment or your own
configuration file before starting. Provide the block-engine and
websocket endpoints and authentication token:

```bash
export JITO_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.block-engine.jito.wtf/api/v1/bundles
export JITO_AUTH=your_token
export JITO_WS_URL=wss://mainnet.block-engine.jito.wtf/api/v1/ws
export JITO_WS_AUTH=your_token
```

The sniper and sandwich agents automatically pass these credentials to
`MEVExecutor` and will read pending transactions from the Jito stream
when both variables are set. A warning is logged if either variable is
missing while MEV bundles are enabled. The authentication request signs
Jito's challenge with your trading keypair to obtain the JWT; editing
`.env` or exporting `JITO_AUTH` lets you substitute a token retrieved
elsewhere.
