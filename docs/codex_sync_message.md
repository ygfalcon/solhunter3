We need to fix all remaining data and provider issues so the runtime stabilizes and the primary data paths work cleanly without falling back. First, tighten environment validation so startup fails immediately if any key like HELIUS_RPC_URL, HELIUS_WS_URL, or BIRDEYE_API_KEY is missing or still using placeholder text such as YOUR_HELIUS_KEY. All modules should import a single centralized config object instead of reading environment variables independently. Next, replace the deprecated Helius DAS REST helper with a JSON-RPC client that matches their latest schema, removing the legacy “query” field and using standard parameters like tokenType and limit. For token handling, add strict validation so any mint that doesn’t decode to a valid 32-byte Solana public key is filtered out early before being passed into the Rust depth service — this will eliminate all the “expected a sequence of length 32” errors. Then, rework the price provider logic so we rely on clean, primary fetches instead of fallback noise. Use Helius as the primary source, Birdeye as secondary once its API key refreshes, and Jupiter and Pyth only if reachable. Each provider should have a simple retry and cooldown logic: after a few consecutive failures, skip calls for a short backoff window rather than retrying every second. Keep warnings throttled to one per provider per minute so the logs don’t spam. For Birdeye, implement rate limiting and token batching, respecting Retry-After headers and serving cached prices when throttled. The trending and discovery system should primarily use Helius DAS to get fungible token lists, fall back to Raydium or Orca APIs when needed, and only reach out to Birdeye as a last resort within budget. Finally, clean up the network handling — remove the Flask development reloader, ensure it runs in production mode, and verify that only one UI process binds to the port. Once this update is in, the primary data pipeline will run cleanly through Helius and the UI should display stable token data with no duplicate logs, no bad mints, no 400 errors, and no noisy fallbacks — just smooth primary-path execution end to end.
